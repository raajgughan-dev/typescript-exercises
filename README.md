# Beginner Level (Focus: Basic Types, Functions, and Simple Interfaces)

The exercises in this section aim to solidify understanding of fundamental TypeScript features, including primitive types, function typing, and basic object shaping.

## Exercise B1: Basic Type Declarations

> **Goal**: Declare and initialize variables using TypeScript's primitive types.

**Requirements**:

1. Declare a variable `userName` and explicitly assign the type `string`. Initialize it with a name.
2. Declare a variable `userAge` and explicitly assign the type `number`. Initialize it with an age.
3. Declare a variable `isActive` and explicitly assign the type `boolean`. Initialize it.
4. **Self-Check**: Attempt to assign a number to userName to confirm the compiler error.
